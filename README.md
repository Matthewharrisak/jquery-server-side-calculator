## Description


This app is a basic calculator that accepts two input fields with a numerical value and a button with a math operator. Upon pushing the equal sign, the input values and operator value and sent to the server to be solved and then returned to the DOM, to be displayed.


 Learning takes time! And its important to have the tools needed to help futher ones education. This calculator app sents out the solve the problem of access! So, this easy to use calculator is deisgned to be an acessible tool for people trying to learn basic math. 

  
  We solved this problem by keeping the calculator simple with few buttons and allowed for only two inputs.

Additional README details can be found [here](https://github.com/PrimeAcademy/readme-template/blob/master/README.md).
This project will move values from the DOM to the server and compute those values to then return them and append to the DOM. However, currently the answer is showing up as "undefined" on one line and then it appears on another line with the numOne and numTwo values as undefined.
